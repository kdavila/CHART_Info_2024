# The CHART-Info 2024 Dataset

This repository contains the Code and Data for the ICPR 2024 paper titled: "CHART-Info 2024: A dataset for Chart Analysis and Recognition"

# The Dataset

This datasaet was created as a collaboration between people from 4 different universities from different countries. More details about the dataset itself and its creation process can be found in our ICPR 2024 paper. This dataset also follows the conventions set up by the [CHART-Infographics competitions](https://chartinfo.github.io/)
